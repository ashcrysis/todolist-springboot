Hello i am Asher! 
This is an project i am doing while i am studying Spring Boot Java, to make an todolist backlist application that
handles an memory database using H2 db engine and handles user's requests!
to test it you should have an api handler installed, like insomnia or API DOG (which i am using), and make requests in to register users, or tasks.

useful links to testing:
